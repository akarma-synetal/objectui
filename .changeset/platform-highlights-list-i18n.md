Platform highlight + list polish:

- **deriveHighlightFields**: extended the preferred-field list (close_date, due_date, account, contact, …) and now skips fields whose declared type is not "highlight-friendly" (textarea, markdown, json, boolean, rich-text, etc.). Untyped legacy fields still pass through. Prevents long-form/structural fields from ending up in the highlight strip on objects with sparse metadata.
- **ListView bulk-action labels**: bulk-action buttons now resolve their labels through `actionLabel(objectName, action, fallback)` so they pick up app-supplied translations under `_actions.<name>.label`, matching the detail-page page-header overflow menu. Falls back to the previous title-cased string when no resource is found.
