Phase P.0 + P.5: tighten record-detail header chrome.

- `RecordTitleChip` collapses the title row to a single baseline-aligned line — H1, eyebrow object label, copy-id, favorite star — instead of the previous two-row title + subtitle layout.
- `record:details` extends the highlight-field dedup set to also exclude the title field resolved from `objectSchema.primaryField` (or the standard `name`/`full_name`/`title`/`subject`/`display_name`/`label` fallbacks). Removes the duplicate row that previously echoed the H1 (e.g. "客户名称: Acme Corporation") inside the field grid.
